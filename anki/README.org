Anki is installed with flatpak. It puts all the Anki data in
=~/.var/app/net.ankiweb.Anki/data=.

This would make backups harder to do. To fix this, all the Anki data is instead
put in =archive/anki/=, and the original data directory is symlinked to this
one.

There is no install/uninstall scripts for this. Just symlink the directory
manually.
