Configuration files and systemd service configuration for restic.

Restic is a tool for backing up data. It can back up to many different storage
systems, such as local file systems, sftp, Amazon S3, etc. I use it to backup
files to a NAS over sftp.

This configuration sets up systemd to run a restic backup of specified files to
a specified repository, once a day. The service name is 'restic-backup'. If
~notify-send~ is available, a desktop notification will be sent when backup
starts, and when it completes.

Systems loads all connection settings as well as the repo password from
~$HOME/.config/restic/restic-backup.conf~. This file should be chmod:ed to 600.
The installation script will fail if this file does not exist. See
~restic-backup.conf.example~ for an example.

Three scripts are copied to ~$HOME/bin/~:

- ~restic-backup-run.sh~ :: Runs the restic backup. This file is called by systemd when running the backup job.
- ~restic-backup-init-repo.sh~ :: Initializes the restic repository.
- ~restic-backup-info.sh~ :: Prints information about configuration, repo, and
  systemd status.

For running these scripts outside of systemd, the following environment
variables must be set (the same as in the systemd configuration file):

- ~$RESTIC_TARGET~ :: The target repo to back up to.
- ~$RESTIC_SOURCE~ :: The source directory to backup from.
- ~$RESTIC_EXCLUDE_FILE~ :: Path to file with restic exclude patterns.
- ~$RESTIC_BIN~ :: Path to restic binary.
- ~$RESTIC_PASSWORD~ :: Repo password. Optional, restic will prompt for password
  if not set.

Systemd is set up to run the ~restic-backup-run.sh~ once a day.
