Dotfiles.

Configuration files are organized per program, one folder each.

Each folder should have two files:

- ~install.sh~ :: Installs configuration files, backing up the old ones.
- ~uninstall.sh~ :: Removes configuration files, restoring the old ones.

For convenience, the configuration files don't include the ~.~ prefix. It will
be added when installing.

Tested on Debian 11 (Bullseye.)
